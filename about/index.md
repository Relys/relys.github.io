Syler Clayton grew up Fairbanks, Alaska. He was home-schooled until he started attending the <a href="https://www.uaf.edu">University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF)</a> a <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/educators/centers-academic-excellence">Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IA)</a> sponsored by the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency (NSA)</a>,<a href="http://www.defense.gov">Department of Defense (DoD)</a> and <a href="https://www.dhs.gov">Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</a>, at age 16.

In 2014 he received his Masters degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics at the age of 21. His thesis was "Intelligent Management Platform Interface Protocol Security" which he presented to the Universityâ€™s <a href="https://www.alaska.edu/oit">Office of Information and Technology</a> and local <a href="https://www.infragard.org">InfraGuard</a> chapter.

During his studies he worked on several research projects including a Security Audit for a project funded by the DoD. He was also a primary Software Developer for the redesign of the <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu">Computer Science Department website</a> and an Administrator for the <a href="https://www.rave-lab.com">Remotely Accessible Virtual Environment</a>. During graduate school he was a Manager of eight employees in the Computer Science Lab and acted as a T.A. for various classes.

While attending school Syler held positions in the UAF's <a href="http://www.csc.uaf.edu">Cyber Security</a> and Association for Computing Machinery clubs. In 2013 he volunteered as White Team for the <a href="http://www.virtualccdc.com">At-Large Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC)</a>. In 2014 he played on the Blue Team and was appointed the Windows & Linux Expert title. His team placed first in regionals and went on to place third in <a href="http://www.nationalccdc.org">National CCDDC</a> out of an original 180 teams. Pivoting into a more offensive role he currently manages the Red Team for the At-Large CCDC (2015-2018) and plays on the Pacific Rim CCDC (2016).

After graduate school Syler worked as a Software Developer/Analyst for a small consluting company <a href="https://www.resdat.com">Resource Data Inc</a> then at HP Inc. 4.5 years, Oracle Cloud Infrastrcutre for 4 years and as of most recent Amazon Lab126 doing embedded systems penetration testing.

Syler likes playing and exploiting video games and embedded devices. He helped reverse engineer the crypto system of the Nintendo 3DS and released a suite of <a href="https://github.com/Relys/3DS_Multi_Decryptor">decryption tools</a>. He also helped reverse engineer the Wii U and develop a <a href="https://github.com/wiiudev/libwiiu">full chain of exploits</a> to gain initial access to the system. This included WebKit vulnerability hunting, heap grooming, return oriented programming, timing based side channel attacks and exploitation of a race condition in the kernel. He likes to participate in various CTF's and has helped host the <a href="https://twitter.com/veganzombiesctf">Vegan Zombies</a> CTF at <a href="http://www.bsidespdx.org/">BSidesPDX</a>.
